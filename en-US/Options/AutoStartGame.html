        <p class="text">
            In the Final Suspect mod, we have optimized the auto-start logic so that the countdown is triggered when the lobby is nearly full.<br>
            When the number of players in the lobby reaches <mark>max capacity - 1</mark> (i.e., only one player short of being full), Final Suspect will initiate a 10-second short countdown.<br>
            During the countdown, the host can manually cancel.<br>
            This mechanism not only avoids delays after the lobby is full, but also prevents the game experience from being affected by the last player joining too late.
